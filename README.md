# Cellular-Automata-and-its-Applications

In this project, we have studied Cellular Automata and relevant concepts. We also simulated some of the applications of Cellular Automata namely:
 
* Snowflake Formation
* Forest Fire Propagation
* Wave Propagation 

In **Snowflake Formation**, a Hexagonal Cellular Automata is used for simulation. Various rules are implemented to simulate the corresponding stages observed in the formation of crystal structure of a Snowflake. The crystal structure grows outwards while maintaining hexagonal symmetry.

In **Forest Fire Propagation**, a Probabilistic Cellular Automata is used for simulation. The Fire Spreading Probability is responsible for the Fire Spread in the Forest which is represented as 2D grid with some cells having vegetation and others being barren.

In **Wave Propagation**, 2D Cellular Automata is used to simulate the wave propagation through an irregularity (damage) in a material plate. The irregularity causes the wave velocity and pressure at that point to change upon incidence.
